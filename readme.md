# The Cube Programming Language

**Cube** is a modern, high-level programming language that combines functional and object-oriented programming styles. The language's core philosophy is to support efficient code, by enabling programmers to write short programs with an emphasis on readability.

## Syntax

Cube uses a verb-based [dependency grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar) with an intuitive syntax, inspired by both SQL and pseudocode.
