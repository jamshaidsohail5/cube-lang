# The Cube Programming Language

**Cube** is a modern, high-level language that combines functional and object-oriented programming. The language's core philosophy is to support efficient code, by enabling developers to write short intuitive programs with a clear and readable syntax.

## Inspiration

[Pseudocode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcQMBK53UjI) is a fundamental concept in Computer Science for both education and design, and is used to explain how algorithms work, independently of any specific programming language.

What makes pseudocode so powerful is that any computer program, even a highly complex one, can be described using a combination of simple mathematical notation and basic operations. Programs written in pseudocode are readable because they use use conventional words to describe programs (such as **if**, **while**, **do** and **end**) and avoid unnecessary punctuation and unclear symbols.

Compared to programming languages that have more complex syntax, this is easier for humans to read, but more challenging for machines to process. Cube uses a flexible [dependency grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar) inspired by pseudocode, and shares readable coding style with other similarly-inspired languages, including [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)), [Ruby](https://github.com/ThibaultJanBeyer/cheatsheets/blob/master/Ruby-Cheatsheet.md) and [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(SQL)).
