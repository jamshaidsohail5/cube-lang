# The Cube Programming Language

**Cube** is a modern, high-level language that combines functional and object-oriented programming. The language's core philosophy is to support efficient code, by enabling developers to write short intuitive programs with clear and readable syntax.

## Inspiration

Most computer programs describe algorithms, which are sets of instructions that when executed provide the solution to a specific problem. In software development, simple, clear programs that are easy to modify and test are highly valued by the programming community, compared to more complex programs that may solve the same problem.

Cube is primarily inspired by [pseudocode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcQMBK53UjI), a fundamental concept in Computer Science for both education and software design, that is used to explain how algorithms work, independently of any specific programming language.

What makes pseudocode so powerful is the idea that any computer program, even a highly complex one, can be easily described using a combination of simple mathematical notation and basic operations. Programs written in pseudocode are easier to understand because they use conventional words to describe instructions (such as **if**, **while**, **do** and **end**) and avoid complex grammar or unfamiliar symbols.

Compared to programming languages that have more complex syntax, this is easier for humans to read, but more challenging for machines to process. Cube shares its readable coding style with other similarly-inspired languages, including [Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC), [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)), [Ruby](https://github.com/ThibaultJanBeyer/cheatsheets/blob/master/Ruby-Cheatsheet.md) and [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(SQL)).

A second source of inspiration is [dependency grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar), a flexible framework used in Computational Linguistics research for processing a wide variety of different natural languages. Cube uses a dependency grammar that is easily extensible. This simplifies the creation of domain specific languages, and allows the core features of different programming language families (such as functional programming and SQL) to be more easily integrated into a single consistent syntax.
