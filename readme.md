# The Cube Programming Language

**Cube** is a modern, high-level language that combines functional and object-oriented programming. The language's core philosophy is to support efficient code, by enabling developers to write short intuitive programs with clear and readable syntax.

## Inspiration

Most computer programs describe algorithms, which are sets of instructions that when executed provide the solution to a specific problem. Simple, clear programs are highly valued by the programming community, as they promote reuse and are far easier to update, mantain and test, compared to more complex programs that may solve the same problem.

Cube is inspired by [pseudocode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcQMBK53UjI), a fundamental concept in Computer Science for both education and design, that is used to explain how algorithms work, independently of any specific programming language.

What makes pseudocode so powerful is that any computer program, even a highly complex one, can be easily described using a combination of simple mathematical notation and basic operations. Programs written in pseudocode are readable because they use conventional words to describe instructions (such as **if**, **while**, **do** and **end**) and avoid complex grammar or unfamilar symbols.

Compared to programming languages that have more complex syntax, this is easier for humans to read, but more challenging for machines to process. Cube uses a flexible [dependency grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar) inspired by pseudocode, and shares its more readable coding style with other similarly-inspired languages, including [Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC), [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)), [Ruby](https://github.com/ThibaultJanBeyer/cheatsheets/blob/master/Ruby-Cheatsheet.md) and [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(SQL)).
