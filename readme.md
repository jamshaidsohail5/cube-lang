# The Cube Programming Language

Cube is a high-level programming language that combines features of both functional and object-oriented programming styles. The language's core philosophy is to support efficient code, by enabling short programs to be written while maintaining readability. Cube uses an intuitive [dependency grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar) that is already familiar to most programmers, inspired by both SQL and pseudocode.
