# The Cube Programming Language

**Cube** is a modern, high-level language that combines functional and object-oriented programming styles. The language's core philosophy is to support efficient code, by enabling developers to write short intuitive programs with an emphasis on readability.

Cube uses a flexible [dependency grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar) inspired by [pseudocode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcQMBK53UjI), and shares a common syntax with other pseudocode-inspired languages such as [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(SQL)), [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)) and [Julia](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia/Controlling_the_flow).
